# Linear Regression Using Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
This repository provides a sample MATLAB code in order to perform a supervised Machine Learning algorithm (Linear Regression) using the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox of the MATLAB. 
# Organization of the Repository
The main MATLAB file is named "LinearRegressionAutoToolbox.m". 
You may feed the algorithm with whatever dataset you wish, no matter what the dimension is. However, two sets of input data are included as an example to implement the algorithm. Depending on the number of variables your dataset has, the algorithm may plot the input data, linear fit and cost fundtion. 
The codes are self-explanatory and contain comments to improve your understanding of what is going on. Furthermore, wherever any intervention is required, the comments in the code prompt you to do so. 
# Input Data
The file data1n.txt is a one-variable dataset and contains the data for linear regression in order to predict profits for a food truck. We have data for profits of different food trucks in different cities. Using this data base, we would like to select which cities to expand to next. In  The first column is the population of a city and the second column is the profit of a food truck in that city. A negative value for profit indicates a loss. 
The file ex1data2.txt is a two-variable dataset and contains a training set of housing prices in Portland, Oregon in order to predict a good market price. The first column is the size of the house (in square feet), the second column is the number of bedrooms, and the third column is the price of the house.
